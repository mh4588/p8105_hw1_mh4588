# Problem 1
```{r problem 1}
#Load the penguins dataset from the palmerpenguins package
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```
The dataset for this problem is "Penguins" from the "Palmer Penguins" package, with the variables `r names(penguins) `. There are `r nrow(penguins)` rows and `r ncol(penguins)` columns within the dataset. 

Among the penguins in the dataset with known flipper lengths, the mean flipper length is `r mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)` millimeters.
